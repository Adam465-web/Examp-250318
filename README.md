To create a bootable USB drive for Windows 10, follow these steps:
Prepare the USB Flash Drive:
Use a USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. Ensure it's empty, as the process will erase all existing data on it.
Download the Windows 10 ISO File:

Visit Microsoft's official website to download the Windows 10 ISO file.
Create the Bootable USB:
Using Microsoft's Media Creation Tool:
Download and run the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's website.
Accept the license terms when prompted.
Select "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC" and click "Next."
Choose the language, edition, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) for Windows 10.
Select "USB flash drive" as the media to use.
Choose your USB drive from the list and click "Next."
The tool will download Windows 10 and create the bootable USB drive.
Using Rufus (Alternative Method):
Download Rufus, a free utility that creates bootable USB drives.
Insert your USB flash drive into the computer.
Open Rufus; it should automatically detect your USB drive.
Under "Boot selection," click "SELECT" and choose the Windows 10 ISO file you downloaded.
Ensure the "Partition scheme" is set to "GPT" (for UEFI systems) or "MBR" (for BIOS systems).
Click "START" to begin creating the bootable USB drive.
After completing these steps, your USB drive will be ready to install or repair Windows 10 on a compatible computer.
